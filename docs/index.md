## Intro  
I will go over a few interesting and important items to remember that I learned from this weekâ€™s lecture. Lastly, I will show a program that uses pickling to read and write binary files and an example of error handling.

The next function is *readlines()*, which reads all the lines in a file, and returns a list. This is helpful when you want to read in all your data at one time into a list. 


Using loops is a great way to capture data from a file. The for and while loops can both be used to iterate through file. For loop has a nice feature that it will automatically close the file once done.
